## The Experimental Logic

$$ATE = E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]$$

- Under random assignment of $D$, there is no expected difference in the covariate profiles of units assigned to treatment and control:

$$E[X_i|D_i=1] - E[X_i|D_i=0] = 0$$

- Thus because of covariate "balance":
$$E[Y_i(0)|X_i,D_i=1] = E[Y_i(0)|X_i,D_i=0]$$

## Design challenges

- Design challenges arise when the randomization breaks down such the treatment and control groups no long have equivalent characteristics in expectation:

1. Non-compliance
2. Interference
3. Attrition

- All of these challenges cause bias when they affect the experimental groups differently
- All of these challenges change the estimand when not random, even if they affect experimental groups equally


## Non-compliance

*Definition*: units take up treatment other than as assigned

- Here we expand the notation such that $d$ is the receipt of treatment and $w$ is the assignment of treatment
- For example $d_i(w_i=1) = d_i(1) = 0$ is a subject that does not receive treatment when assigned to treatment

- Other examples:
    + Not all treated PFOs participate in the PES program (Uganda)
    + Not all villages buy into the micro-grid as assigned (India)


## Non-compliance example: KCCA reporting platform

## Types of units

- Compliers: $d_i(1) = 1$ and $d_i(0) = 0$
- Never-Takers: $d_i(1) = 0$ and $d_i(0) = 0$

We assume that each unit's type is fixed conditional on the experimental setting

*One-sided non-compliance:* some subjects assigned to treatment are not treated ("failure-to-treat")

- For example $d_i(w_i=1) = d_i(1) = 0$ is a subject that does not receive treatment when assigned to treatment.

(These are the only two groups under one-sides non-compliance, it gets more complicated with two-sided non-compliance, which we will not cover)


## Types of units cont.

There are three important things to keep in mind about the notation on non-compliance:

1. This notation has nothing to do with outcomes $Y_i$, it is about the fixed type of each unit
2. We are assuming a binary treatment, with no dosage possible
3. Each unit's type depends on background characteristics and the experimental context


## Intent to Treat

- In this style of analysis, non-compliance is ignored:
$$ITT = E[Y_i(w_i=1)|w_i=1] - E[Y_i(w_i=0)|w_i=0]$$
- This is a useful quantity for many implementing agencies, since they want to know about the effectiveness of interventions inclusive of non-compliance

This contrasts with the ATE:
$$ATE = E[Y_i(d_i=1)|d_i=1] - E[Y_i(d_i=0)|d_i=0]$$

- $ITT = ATE$ when there is full compliance
- We cannot estimate the ATE in an unbiased way using receipt of treatment when non-compliance is present, because $d_i$ is not randomly assigned


## Non-compliance example: KCCA reporting platform

![](figures/14-kcca-itt.png)

    
## Complier Average Causal Effects (CACE)

$$ CACE = E[ Y_i(d=1)-Y_i(d=0) | d_i(1)=1 ] $$

- CACE is the ATE *among* compliers; the problem is that compliance in the control group might not be visible.


## Complier Average Causal Effects (CACE) estimation

1. when you have measures of compliance in both treatment and control (placebo designs)
    + depends on the excludability assumption that compliance does not depend on treatment assignment
    
2. $CACE = ITT/ITT_D = \frac{ITT}{(\sum_{w_i=1}d_i/\sum w_i))}$
    + ATE is weighted average of zero effect among never-takers and treatment effect among compliers
    + Assumes large samples
    + Local average treatment effects (LATE) via instrumental variables

**Not okay:** Estimate ATE on subset of observed compliers (all control; compliers treated)

**Compare only groups formed by random assignment**


## Non-compliance: practical strategies

- Randomize conditional on contact with research subjects
- Randomize conditional on psuedo-compliance check
- Design treatments such that receipt of treatment is only available in cooperation with experimenters
- Design treatments so that there is no non-compliance!


## Interference (a.k.a. spillover)

*Definition*: units are affected by the treatment status of other units

- Two implications of interference:
    1. different estimand
    2. unequal probability of exposure to spillover
    

## Interference example: PITI evaluation

![](figures/14-piti-sample.png)


## Some expanded notation

**Non-interference (SUTVA):** treatment assignment of other units does not affect potential outcomes of unit $i$.
$$E[Y_i(1)] \equiv E[Y_i(1) | D_j]$$

- Under interference, we can expand the set of potential outcomes to include direct and indirect treatment, such was potential outcomes is $Y(d_i=1,i_i=1)$, where unit $i$ is exposed to direct treatment $d$ and indirect treatment $i$.

- Assume that $i$ is active under some given process of spillover (e.g. continguity)
- To estimate the ATE in the way we have discussed we have to assume that:
$$Y(d_i=1,i_i=1) = Y(d_i=1,i_i=0) \text{ and }$$ 
$$Y(d_i=0,i_i=1) = Y(d_i=0,i_i=0)$$
for all potential spillover processes $i$.

## Interference: a simple example

![](figures/12-fig8-1.png)

- Assume some baseline $Y_i(d_i=0,i_i=0)$ for all Y
- Assume that the direct treatment effect of $d_i$ is 2
- Assume that the indirect treatment effect $i_i$, which is active when a unit located next to at least one treated unit is 1

## Estimating the treatment effect of indirect exposure

- **Assuming** we have identified the correct spillover process $i$, we can estimate its effects
    + Recognize that units have different probabilities of assignment to indirect exposure
    + Use *inverse probability weighting*: the units that have a low probability of assignment to treatment will not show up as often as observed outcomes and thus need to be re-weighted so that on average these units take their equal place in the observed outcomes


## Interference: practical strategies

- Leave non-experimental units not possibily affect by spillover
- Cluster assignment at level where spillover is expected
    + such that after clustering, interference between clusters is unlikely (taking into power implications)
- Robustness checks for different spillover processes
- Two-level designs where exposure to spillover is randomized

## Interference: PITI example

## Attrition

*Definition*: units drop out of study prior to the collection of outcome data

- Attrition is a large concern when it is different by treatment condition
- Even without differential attrition, interpretation can be difficult, since the effective sample might not be the target sample after attrition


## Attrition: Uganda Twaweza example

![](figures/14-vote-choice-sample.png)

## Examples of attrition

- Subjects unreachable at endline
- Treated subjects become uncooperative with the research team
- Access to some outcomes is blocked


## Attrition and biased estimation

Define a new potential outcome that indicates whether an outcome is reported for subject $i$, such that $r_i=1$ when the outcome is reported and $r_i=0$ when the outcome is not reported.

We can re-write the ATE (of the whole sample) conditional on non-missingness as:
$$ATE=E[Y_i(1)| r_i(1)=1)-Y_i (0)|r_i(0)=1)]$$

- This looks very much like the ATE we have seen, *except* $r$ is not randomly assigned
- Thus, if $r$ is related to potential outcomes $E[Y_i(1)| r_i(1)=1)] = E[Y_i(1)]$


## Attrition that is not problematic

Thus, the only case where attrition does not cause bias is when:
$$E[Y_i(1)| r_i(1)=1)] = E[Y_i(1)| r_i(1)=0)]$$
$$E[Y_i(0)| r_i(0)=1)] = E[Y_i(0)| r_i(0)=0)]$$

- That is, when missingness is indepedent of potential outcomes

## Solution 1: MIPO

- "Missing Indepedent of Potential Outcomes" - this is a strategy of making assumptions about the relationship between missingness and potential outcomes

$$Y_i (w) { \perp\!\!\!\perp } r_i (w)$$
- If missingness is indepedent of potential outcomes, there should be no association between missingness and covariates that are prognostic of $Y_i(w)$.


## Solution 2: MIPO|X

- "Missing Indepedent of Potential Outcomes given $X$" - after partitioning the sample by some $X$, missingness is MIPO within partitions.

- If this assumption holds, can estimate the ATE by taking a weighted average of partions, such that:
$$E[Y_i(1)]=\frac{1}{N} \sum \frac{Y_i(1)r_i(1)}{\pi(w_i=1,x)}$$
where $\pi(w_i=1,x)$ is the share of non-missing subjects among all treated subjects.

- The implicit weight is higher for partions that have more missingness
- Note the value of collecting pre-treatment data to assess these assumptions


## Solution 3: Missingness independent of treatment assignment

- When missingness is indepedent of treatment assignment ($r_i(1)=r_i(0)$), we can get to an unbiased estimate of the ATE within the group of *Always-Reporters*

- Always-Reporters: $r_i(1) = 1$ and $r_i(0) = 1$
- Never-Reporters: $r_i(1) = 0$ and $r_i(0) = 0$

- Test: $\chi^2$ test for difference in rates of attrition
- The potential outcomes of Always-Reporters may be different from the whole sample

## Attrition: Uganda example

![](figures/14-vc-attrition.png)

## Intensive follow-up to characterize attrited subjects

- Select a random sample of subjects for *intensive* follow-up, such that the follow-up procedure guarantees no attrition
- Assuming no attrition in *intensive* follow-up, the follow-up subjects provide an unbiased estimate for all the missing subjects

- *Caution*: have to consider whether intensive follow-up changes the potential outcomes


## Practical solutions: attrition

- Pilot strategies for follow-up data collection
- Select sample such that attrition is less problematic (careful about changing target inference)
- Identify "intensive" follow-up strategy with little attrition
- Identify back-up ways to contact subjects 
- Use measurements that do not depend on contact with human subjects
